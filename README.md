# green-buttons-mixin

These buttons are designed to appear like flat keys when solo, or like an old-school stereo panel when grouped. They have a small amount of animation when clicked, but otherwise maintain the current preference for flat presentation.

See the index.html file for how the default buttons will look.

You can change the colors at the default level or add a custom value to the @include mixin parameters.

The six-pack format looks best with uniform width, though the middle buttons can be different than the outer buttons, as long as they are the same.
